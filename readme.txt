The user thinks of a number between 1 and 99 without revealing it to the computer (the number is not given as an input to the computer).

We run the program.

The program makes a guess and prints a number.

Based on the printed number, there are three possible scenarios:

1. If the printed number is larger than the number you are thinking of, you type the letter 'k' to tell the program that your number is smaller. The program should then guess a smaller number than its previous guess to finish the game sooner.

2. If the printed number is smaller than the number you are thinking of, you type the letter 'b' to tell the program that your number is larger. The program should then guess a larger number than its previous guess to finish the game sooner.

3. If the printed number matches the number you are thinking of, you type the letter 'd' to tell the program that it has guessed correctly and the game ends.
