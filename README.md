# Number Guessing (Computer Guesses)

A tiny CLI game: think of a number (1–99) and the computer guesses it using **binary search**.

## How to Run
python main.py

## How to Play
- **larger** → your number is bigger than my guess  
- **smaller** → your number is smaller than my guess  
- **Bingo!** → I guessed your number correctly

## Example
50
larger
75
smaller
62
smaller
57
Bingo!
Finally I got it!!

## Dev Notes
- Python ≥ 3.10  
- Run tests: `python -m unittest`
