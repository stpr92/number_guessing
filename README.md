# Number Guessing (Computer Guesses)

A tiny CLI game: think of a number (1–99) and the computer guesses it using **binary search**.

## How to Run
python main.py

## How to Play
- **k** → your number is smaller  
- **b** → your number is bigger  
- **d** → **done** (correct)

## Example
Is it 50? [k/b/d] b
Is it 75? [k/b/d] k
Is it 62? [k/b/d] b
Is it 68? [k/b/d] d
Yay! Guessed in 4 steps.

## Dev Notes
- Python ≥ 3.10  
- Run tests: `python -m unittest`
